# BMD-X
OS X client for the BMD genealogy database

This is the code for a port of the original MacBMD software which stopped running with Apples Mountain Lion system release. It exectaly replicates the UI of the original :-/.

If you are not already a transcriber for the FreeBMD project you have no need to download this software. It has no use other than transcribing records.
