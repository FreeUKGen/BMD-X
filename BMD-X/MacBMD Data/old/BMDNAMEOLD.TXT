 This table is a key part of SpeedBMD so please
 take care when making changes. If you do mess
 it up then use "Explore" to delete BMDNAME2.TXT
 then start again, the original BMDNAME.TXT will
 then be copied to BMDNAME2.TXT and you can try
 again.

 The main rule is keep all names starting with
 the same letter together. They do not have to
 be in strict alphabetical order so you may
 prefer to put the ones you find most frequently
 near the top.

 Also make sure that each name is typed hard over
 to the left of the line. Any line starting with
 a blank (like this one) is ignored when loading
 the table.

 This file was generated by including all forenames
 in the current Free-BMD database with more than
 100 occurences.
